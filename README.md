# rust-icmptime

Simple commandline tool in rust to send ICMP time request packets, inspired by [TCP Illustrated](http://books.google.com/books/about/TCP_IP_Illustrated_Volume_1.html?id=a23OAn5i8R0C).

Writing this as a learning tool for rust and TCP/IP. Very much a work in progress. 

Uses rust [libpnet](https://github.com/libpnet/libpnet) in probably suboptimal and incorrect ways.
